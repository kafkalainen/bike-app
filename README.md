# bike-app
## Description of the project: What is the purpose of the project and what features it has?

## Technology choices: List chosen technologies. Itâ€™s also nice to know why you chose those technologies.

## Prerequisites

Should the reviewer install something on their computer before they can compile and run the project? Does the project only work on Windows or Linux? List all steps that need to be done before trying to run the project. If versions are important, remember to mention those as well. 
## Configurations

Do you have to configure for example database connections locally?
Provide clear instructions on what needs to be changed and where.
In case you have an .env file which you, of course, should not add to GitHub,
you can send that file to the reviewers by other means.

# How to run the project?

Do you have to install some packages or compile the code?
If you have separate services for example for backend and frontend,
remember to write instructions for all needed services.

# Tests

If your project has tests, include instructions on how to run them.

# TODO: If some things are missing or not working, you can list them in README.
